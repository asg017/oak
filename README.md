# oak - a new take

oak got very complex, very fast. Most of it was my fault, adding new features when the core idea wasn't fully baked yet, or doing weird workarounds to make it work a certain way.

This is a new start to the same core idea, but with key differences.

1. Instead of node, using quickjs.
2. Focus on a very tight core program that other programs can hook into later on.

lets hope it works!
